# N Letter Triangle Pattern

## Problem Statement

Generate an **N Letter Triangle** for a given integer n.  
Each row contains:
- Sequential uppercase letters starting from 'A'
- Each row i prints the first i letters of the English alphabet

This forms a **right-angled triangle** of letters.

---

## Approach

To create the letter triangle pattern:
1. Loop through each row i from 1 to n.
2. For each row:
   - Use a nested loop to print i characters.
   - Start from the ASCII value of 'A' and increment using chr(ord("A") + j).

## Python Code

```python
def nLetterTriangle(n: int) -> None:
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            print(chr(ord("A") + j), end = " ")
        print()

```

### Sample Input:
n = 4

### sample Output:
```
A 
A B 
A B C 
A B C D 

```

### Complexity Analysis:
**Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²)
Each row prints i characters, totaling 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n + 1)/2 characters.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
Only loop counters are used; no additional data structures are required.

### Learning Outcomes:
Understand how to work with ASCII values using ord() and chr() in Python.

Practice with nested loops for pattern construction.

Learn to generate alphabetic patterns programmatically.
